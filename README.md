## Abstract
The paper proposes a comparative study between two models that can be used by researchers for the analysis of survival data: Weibull regression and, random survival forest. The models are compared considering the error rate, the performance of the model through the Harrell's C-index, and the identification of the relevant variables for survival prediction. A statistical analysis of a data set from the Heart Institute of the University of S\~{a}o Paulo, Brazil, has been carried out. The proposal has many applications in biology and medicine.
